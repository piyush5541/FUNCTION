This \"compilation\" process happens once, and then the executable can be run directly and often very quickly. Ex- C, C++ Interpreted languages are translated and executed line by line, or instruction by instruction, by an interpreter during runtime. There's no separate pre-compilation step. This offers flexibility for quick changes and testing, but typically results in slower execution. Ex- Python\n",

        "# What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The finally block in Python ensures that a specific block of code is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised in the try block or not. Its primary purpose is for cleanup operations.\n",

        "# What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- he del method in Python is a special method called when an object is about to be garbage collected. Its significance lies in providing a last chance for the object to perform cleanup operations, such as releasing external resources that the object might have held.\n",

        "# What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, import module_name brings the entire module into your namespace. To access items within it, you need to prefix them with the module name (e.g., module_name.function()). On the other hand, from module_name import item_name imports specific items (like functions or classes) directly into your current namespace, allowing you to use them without the module prefix (e.g., function()).\n",

        "# What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",

        "# What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, multithreading involves running multiple threads concurrently within a single process, sharing the same memory space. This is useful for I/O-bound tasks to improve responsiveness. Multiprocessing, on the other hand, utilizes multiple separate processes, each with its own memory space. This allows for true parallelism on multi-core processors, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",

        "# What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Firstly, it provides a structured way to record events with different severity levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error), making it easier to filter and analyze important messages. Secondly, logs can be directed to various outputs like files or network streams, allowing for persistent and centralized monitoring. Thirdly, logging often includes timestamps and contextual information, aiding in debugging and understanding program flow.\n",

        "# What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory management in Python is largely automatic, handled by the Python Memory Manager. It involves allocating memory for objects when they are created and deallocating it when they are no longer in use. Python uses techniques like reference counting and garbage collection to reclaim memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The basic steps in Python exception handling involve first identifying the code that might raise an error and enclosing it within a try block. Then, you define one or more except blocks to catch specific exception types that might occur. Inside each except block, you write the code to handle that particular exception, preventing program termination. Optionally, a finally block can be included for code that always needs to execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory management is crucial in Python to ensure efficient resource utilization and prevent program crashes. Automatic memory management, through techniques like garbage collection, reclaims memory occupied by unused objects, freeing it up for new ones. Without proper memory management, programs could consume excessive memory, leading to slowdowns or even out-of-memory errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The try block in Python encloses the code that might potentially raise an exception (an error). If an exception occurs within this try block, the normal flow of execution is interrupted. The except block then comes into play; it defines the code that should be executed if a specific type of exception occurs in the preceding try block. This allows the program to handle errors instead of crashing, providing a mechanism for recovery or controlled termination.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python's garbage collection primarily uses reference counting. Each object keeps track of how many other parts of the program are referencing it. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it's automatically deallocated.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The else block in Python's exception handling is executed only if no exceptions were raised in the preceding try block. Its purpose is to contain code that depends on the successful execution of the try block. This helps to clearly separate the code that might raise exceptions from the code that should only run when things go smoothly, improving code readability and logic.\n",

        "# What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- DEBUG (detailed information for debugging), INFO (general information about program execution), WARNING (potential issues that haven't caused errors yet), ERROR (significant problems that prevented some functionality), and CRITICAL (severe errors that may lead to program termination). Choosing the appropriate level helps in filtering and focusing on relevant log messages.\n",

        "# What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- os.fork() is a low-level Unix system call that creates a new process by duplicating the existing one, including its memory space. It's fast but can be unsafe with threads. Multiprocessing is a Python module that provides a higher-level, platform-independent way to spawn processes. It typically uses os.fork() on Unix-like systems and a different mechanism on Windows where os.fork() is unavailable.\n",

        "# What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Closing a file in Python is crucial for several reasons. It ensures that any buffered data waiting to be written to the file is actually flushed to disk, preventing data loss. Secondly, it releases the system resources held by the open file, making them available for other processes or operations. Failing to close files can lead to resource leaks, file corruption, and limitations on the number of files a program can have open simultaneously.\n",

        "# What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, impacting performance when dealing with large in-memory data.

        "- We can manually raise an exception in Python using the raise keyword.

This concurrency can prevent the application from freezing or becoming unresponsive during these waiting periods, making it feel faster.\n"
