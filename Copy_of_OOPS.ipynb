        "- It's a programing paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which encapsulate both data and the code that operates on that data. This approch aims to make code more modular, resuable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "# what is a class in OOPS?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "# what is an object in OOPS?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It's the actual, concrete entity created based on the blueprint provided by the class. If a class is the cookie cutter, an object is a specific cookie made with that cutter.\n",

        "# what is difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction: Focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It's about dealing with the \"what\" rather than the \"how.\" Think of using a remote control â€“ you use buttons (abstracted interface) without needing to know the intricate circuitry inside.\n",
        "Encapsulation: Bundles data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit (a class). It restricts direct access to the data and prevents accidental modification. This is like a protective capsule around the data.\n",

        "# what are dunder method in python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods are special methods in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names, like __init__ or __str__. They are also known as \"magic methods.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# explain the concept of inheritance in oop.\n",
        "- Inheritance is a fundamental principle in OOP that allows a new class (called the subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (called the superclass or base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "# what is polymorphism in oop?\n",
        "- Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In OOP, it refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way. This means you can use a single interface (method name) to perform different actions based on the type of object you are working with.\n",

        "\n",
        "# what is an abstract class in python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a template or blueprint for other classes. It defines methods that must be implemented by any class that inherits from it. However, the abstract class itself does not provide the actual implementation code for these methods. Think of it as a set of requirements that any class inheriting from it must fulfill.\n",
        "\n",
        "# what are the advantages of oops?\n",
        "- Modularity for easier troubleshooting: OOP helps break down complex problems into smaller, self-contained units (objects), making it easier to identify and fix issues.\n",

        "__repr__: This method is intended to provide an unambiguous representation of an object. It should ideally be a string that, if evaluated, would recreate the object.

        "- method chaining is a technique in object-oriented programming where you call multiple methods on an object in a single expression.
